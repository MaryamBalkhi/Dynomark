                <h2>BFuel and Exhaust System Controls</h2>
                <p>The fuel exhaust system has an important point in auto expertise controls.<br>

The exhaust system is exposed to harsh conditions depending on internal and external factors during use. If we explain, it uses the exhaust system during the exit of the gases consumed in the cylinders of the engine from the vehicle. Burnt gases have certain heat and pressure when making this exit. These temperatures and pressures heat the exhaust parts too much. In the meantime, it may be exposed to cooling with the sudden water coming to the heated exhaust. In transitions from cold to hot-hot to cold, the exhaust may be deformed depending on time.<br>

The exhaust system, which is exposed to all these in the moving vehicle, also gets its share from external factors. Stone, mud, water, soil, gravel ... In fuel exhaust components working under such heavy conditions, puncture, cracking, irregular operation, leakage, fuel odour, etc. situations occur over time. These situations adversely affect vehicle performance and cause excess fuel consumption. In addition to these, it harms the nature and human health with the output of harmful gases without being processed (without minimising the harm).<br>

 For these reasons, we state that it is important for our customers who will buy a second-hand vehicle to come to Dynomark Auto Expertise Branches before buying the vehicle and have the Fuel Exhaust System Controls of the vehicle.<br>

In Dynomark Auto Expertise, Fuel Exhaust System Controls are controlled by engine mechanics in a professional, impartial and detailed manner by engine mechanics in a lighted environment on the vehicle lift. At the same time, the fuel exhaust system is checked while the vehicle is running.<br>
